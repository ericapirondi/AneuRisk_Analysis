# AneuRisk_Analysis
This GitHub repository introduces a project with two primary objectives.
Firstly, it involves an exaustive analysis of the AneuRisk dataset, focusing on the influence of geometric features, such as curvature and radius, on the rupture of aneurysms situated within the carotid artery.
Secondly, the project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a neural network capable of successfully achieving the task of automatically classifying 3D artery reconstructions as ruptured or unruptured.
